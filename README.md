# Training
The training folder contains the notebook links for all 6 models: ConvNextV2, SwinV2, MaxVit, VOLO D2, CoAtNet, DenseNet121.
# Testing
The testing folder contains the notebooks for :
1) running trained models on test dataset with average weighted ensemble
2) finding optimal set of weights for weighted ensembling using differential evolution

TODO:
- Organize and upload notebooks used to train classical models as meta classifier
